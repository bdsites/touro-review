    <h1>Intro to HTML</h1>
    <p>
In this week's class we learn the background of the Web and web programming languages.
We understand how to navigate the computer via the Terminal and install and use Atom.
</p>
<p>
  We learn how to create new html files and their basic elements and saw how boring they look when
      you're just using html alone (like this page!).
      We can add meta data to our files, comment out lines, and add headings and paragraphs.
      </p>
      <p>We learned how to make handy lists like this:<br/>
        <ol>
          <li>One is Hashem!</li>
          <li>Two are the Luchos that Moshe brought</li>
          <li>Three are the Fathers</li>
        </ol>
</p>
      <p>And like this:
        <ul>
          <li>Four are the Mothers</li>
          <li>Five are the Books of the Torah</li>
          <li>Six are the Books of the Mishnah</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

<p>And we can do all kinds of neat lists like these:
        <ul class="purpleIcon">
            <li>Seven are the days of the week</li>
            <li>Eight are the days til the Bris</li>
            <li>Nine are the months until a baby's born</li>
          </ul>
</p>
