    <h1>Intro to CSS</h1>
    <p>In this class, we learn how to see the backend of sites using developer tools.
      We begin an introduction to CSS, including <strong>properties</strong> and <strong>selectors</strong> and the various
      options in formatting HTML elements. We also learn three different ways to define a color within CSS and the priority given
       when there are conflicting CSS commands.
      The three ways we learn to bring CSS into an HTML file are:
       <ol>
         <li>Link to an external stylesheet in the &lt;head&gt; of the document</li>
        <li>Inline CSS</li>
           <li>Include the CSS code in the &lt;head&gt; of file</li>
      <ol>

        <p>We also learned how to make lists appear horizonally, like a nav bar:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HOME</li>
            <li>ABOUT ME</li>
            <li>CONTACT</li>
          </ul>

      <p>

<div>
            <h3>
