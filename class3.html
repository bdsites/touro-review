    <p>In this class, we learn how to see the backend of sites using developer tools.
      We begin an introduction to CSS, understanding <strong>properties</strong> and
      <strong>selectors</strong>, and the formatting potential that's within CSS.
      We learn the three ways to define a color, as well as the priority given
       when there are conflicting CSS commands. We also learn three ways to bring CSS into an HTML file.

            <li>ABOUT ME</li>
            <li>CONTACT</li>
          </ul>
